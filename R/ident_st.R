#' @title Cell identity characterization (DeCEP score) of ST data
#'
#' @description
#' \code{ident_st_score} quantifies the activity of context-specific gene program depend on \link{net_st} for individual spatial locations.
#'
#' @param x_impute A data frame containing spatial gene expression data (after imputation) in a distinct spatial context. For a data frame, each row represents a gene, and each column represents spatial location.
#' @param involvedID A character vector containing the names of spatial locations in the region of interest (ROI) and corresponding neighborhood.
#' @param net A context-dependent functional network obtained by \link{net_st}.
#' @return A data frame with two columns (the column names are "spot_ID" and "DeCEP_score").
#' @export
